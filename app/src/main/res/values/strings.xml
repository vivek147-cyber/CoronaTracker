The lack of a definite cure for the infection makes their work extra tough and there is also the added pressure of calming the nerves of the patients and their families. For this, the doctors not only have to attend to patients in person but also have to stay connected to them over the phone and through video conferencing. The threat of them catching the disease and infecting their own families also looms large over them, due to which most of the doctors have given up going homes and have shifted to solitary accommodations, where they go to take rest after completing their duty hours, which could stretch to 15 or even 18 hours in a day.</string>
